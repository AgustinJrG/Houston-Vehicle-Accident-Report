## Executive Summary

By examining these trends, the report seeks to identify key areas for safety improvements and inform future policy decisions. This analysis of traffic accidents in Houston from 2017 to 2022 reveals key trends that highlight areas for improved road safety and informed policy decisions. Accident density is higher on highway roads, despite their smaller proportion of the city’s road network, and peak accident times align with rush hour periods, particularly between 5-7 am and 3-6 pm. Seasonal spikes in accidents are observed during the first and last quarters of the year, often linked to holiday traffic. Comparisons with other major U.S. cities suggest commuting patterns and population density play a significant role in accident rates. The analysis also shows that Houston’s “Texting While Driving Ban” has contributed to a 16.7% decrease in accidents, though the full impact of other recent traffic laws remains unclear due to pandemic-related traffic disruptions![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d348231-0bf5-47e7-adff-e1f681809283)
